title:  "Ranking Linux Distros"
---
1. Debian
  - never update
  - just works

2. Fedora
  - Too much updating

3. Void
  - Pretty good if you feel like learning another init system

4. OpenSUSE
  - The gentleman's choice

5. Arch
  - Worth the install if you feel like learning the ins and outs of Linux

6. *BSD
  - Seems good

7. Gentoo
  - Compiling software because you don't trust binaries but not reading source code

8. Anything else that's not a derivative
  - At least you will probably learn something

9. Any derivative
  - Why?

10. Ubuntu
  - How is this the go to distro. Their version of GNOME is the laggiest DE ever and
  gives GNOME a bad name
